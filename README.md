# Course-Registration-Using-Java


Introduction



•	I have worked on this project with a combination of MySQL and Java, using JDBC and J connector.



•	The project was done on IntelliJIDEA Ultimate, with the J connector merged before working on the project, hence, it needs to be installed before testing of the queries.



•	I have listed the entire code initially(from Page 3-10) and then divided the code according to the questions.(from Page 11). The SQL queries executed in Workbench are mentioned along with the questions.

How to Work-
1. Open DataAccessLayer.java
